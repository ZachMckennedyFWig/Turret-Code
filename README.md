# Turret-Code
The v5 code for the turret project that I worked on. All written in c++ in vexcode.

In the latest commit, you will find entirely new math for the latency compensation code and a bit sloppier documentation. This new latency compensation math accounts for the time of flight (TOF) of the ball in the air and the velocity imparted on the ball by the chassis movement to adjust the turret for shooting while moving around.
